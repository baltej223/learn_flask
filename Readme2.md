This piece of code is a common pattern used in Python scripts that allows the script to be executed as the main program or imported as a module into another program. Let's break it down:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

1. `__name__`: This is a special variable in Python that holds the name of the current module. When a Python script is executed, its `__name__` variable is set to `'__main__'`. If the script is imported into another module, `__name__` is set to the name of the module.

2. `'__main__'`: This is the name assigned to the script when it is executed directly by the Python interpreter.

So, the condition `if __name__ == '__main__':` checks whether the current script is being run directly by the Python interpreter (as the main program), or if it is being imported as a module into another script.

If the script is being run directly (as the main program), the condition evaluates to `True`, and the code block underneath it will be executed.

In this specific case, `app.run(debug=True)` starts the Flask development server with debugging enabled. So, when you run the script directly (`python app.py`), it will start the Flask server.

If the script is imported as a module into another program, the condition evaluates to `False`, and the code block underneath it will not be executed. This prevents the Flask server from starting when the script is imported into another program, allowing the functions and variables defined in the script to be used by the importing program without starting the server.
